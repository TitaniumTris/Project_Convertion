# Project_Convertion
Just combining practising converting numbers from one number system to other and learning python.

The goal of this "project" of mine is to get a working convertion program, that can convert between binary, octal, decimal and hexadecimal systems with or without decimal points. I also plan to make a ascii ui for it. 

Current progress
------------------
* Finnished the Binary to decimal convertion.
